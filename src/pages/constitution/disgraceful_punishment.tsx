      choosing on their wall until another league loser is determined.

      The Disgraceful Punishment for Sucking So Bad forces the last place finisher to run a beer mile in under 10
      minutes. A beer mile involves drinking a full beer (out of can or bottle only) before each 400m lap. If the runner
      does not break 10 minutes, they will be forced to drink one last beer out of a dog bowl with no hands allowed.
