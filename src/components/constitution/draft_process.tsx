      It is expected that all active league managers make reasonable attempts at arranging and joining a Draft Day
      Party. It is epxected this party have plenty of beers, either a Grill for barbecue or a Table for pizza boxes,
      ample seating, ample electrical outlets, and functional Wi-Fi.

      The draft order will be determined in a random fashion. The Commish and at least one active league manager must
      video tape this process and publish it to the League so that no fraudulent behavior is possible.

      Any active league manager who is able to draft Purple Jesus before he is able to fall to Mark Rodgers immediately
      becomes a favorite of the Commish for that football season. This applies for any future all-stars that may play
      for the Minnesota Vikings as well.

      The draft date must occur after the first scheduled preseason game is played but before the first scheduled
      regular season game is played
    </Text>
    <Text>
      Outside of those draft date boundaries, a best effort must be made by the Commish to select a date that ensures a
      maximum number of managers may attend the draft to avoid auto-picking
