      The Senior Board (The SB)
    </Subheading>
    <Text>The Senior Board, hereafter referred to as the SB, will be comprised of 4 active league managers.</Text>
    <Text>
      Active league managers are defined as persons managing (or co-managing) a fantasy football team for the upcoming
      and/or current NFL season. Their status as an active league manager is not determined nor affected by seasons
      prior or future.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      In addition to the 4 active league managers, the League Commissioner, hereafter referred to as the Commish, will
      sit on the SB but only participate when a deciding 5th vote is required in any matter.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      The SB will be responsible for selecting or re-administering the Commis prior to each fantasy season's draft day,
      each year.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      In the event of a tied vote for a new Commish, the vote will then be opened up to the rest of the League. In the
      event this vote still remains tied, the league's most recent Commish who still remains an active league manager
      will reside as the current year's commissioner.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      Active league managers may choose to step down from residing on the SB during any off-season but not in the middle
      of the fantasy season, and it will become the remaining SB's duty to select a new member at such time.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      The SB will handle all issues such as league complaints and suggestions towards enhancing the League's settings.
      This input is allowed to be from any active league manager and the SB will in turn decide whether or not this
      charter needs ammending.
