      Rosters are not locked all at once. Instead, players are individually locked once their game's start time has

      It is each manager's responsibility to ensure rosters are properly set. IF in the case of computer technical
      difficulties, said manager may reach out to the Commish and inquire if he is able to get access to a computer to
      set the roster on behalf of the computer-less manager. This can only be done on a best efforts basis by the
      Commish

      The SB will in turn decide if the Commish was negligent in his (or her) duties to help out the computer-less
      manager or if the computer-less manager was in fact lying and merely creating a front for purposefully fixing a
      week's matchup. Banning is an appropriate measure of discipline in either of these cases if the SB deems it so
