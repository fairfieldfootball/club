      We the People of the Fairfield Football Club Fantasy Football League, in order to form a more perfect union of
      sarcastically aggressive banter amongst peers and grudgingly difficult transactions of personal finances,
      establish justification of smug condescension at the People's perceived knowledge of the game of American
      football, insure domestic tranquility on the Thursdays, Sundays, Mondays, and occassional Saturday that the People
      of the League must keep sacred, provide for the common defence and offence with which the teams of the People
      prove their worth, promote the general welfare of all players of the game of American football so they may remain
      free of heinous crime and veinous drug as they currently do so exist, and secure the blessings of victory to thine
      self and thine own posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Fantasy Football League of the
      Fairfield Football Club.
